# Overview

NVIDIA IndeX is a 3D volumetric, interactive visualization SDK.  Scientists and
researchers use NVIDIA IndeX to visualize and interact with massive data sets,
make real-time modifications, and navigate to the most pertinent parts of the
data, all in real-time, making it possible to gather better insights faster.
IndeX leverages GPU-accelerated clusters for scalable, real-time, visualization
and computing of multi-valued, volumetric data together with embedded geometry
data.
